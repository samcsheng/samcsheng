- 👋 Hi, I’m @samcsheng
- 👀 I’m interested in everything to do with BI Softwares, particularly MS Power Platform Apps.

      and solving real-world problems within the company I'm working for (an international fashion retail company),
      from the perspective of a financial analyst.

      I would love to meet with anyone on the same journey ;)
